# Lab5_Analog_to_Digital_Conversion
In today's laboratory we will check out the Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) module. Therefore, we will first configure our ADC-module so that it uses the potentiometer of our development board as an input and print its current voltage level on the display. We will then automate the conversion so that it is performed at regular intervals to automatically receive voltage level updates. Last but not least, we will use our LEDs to show how many quarters of our reference voltage are currently measured by the ADC, like a battery level indicator.

The experts among you will get a simple exercise, a binary counter based on the ADC. But is it really simple, or is there a hidden trap?

## Relevant registers
For today's laboratory we will need the previously used registers to configure our Oscialltor, I/O pins, Timers, CCP Module, and the
registers introduced in the lecture. All those registers are listed below. Please check them to ensure you are aware
of all relevant registers for today.

## Relevant chapters of the datasheet
We will use many of the available modules of our microcontroller today. Thus, the relevant chapters of the datasheet 
for today's laboratory are listed below.
- 2.0 OSCILLATOR MODULE (WITH FAIL-SAFE CLOCK MONITOR)
- 9.0 INTERRUPTS
- 10.0 I/O PORTS
- 12.0 TIMER1/3/5 MODULE WITH GATE CONTROL
- 14.0 CAPTURE/COMPARE/PWM MODULES
- 17.0 ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC) MODULE

## Exercise 1 - Configuring the ADC
As told in the lecture, you need to configure the ADC-modules timings; $T_{AD}$ sets the time each processing step of the ADC-module consumes (tipically set to 2Âµs). $T_{ACQ}$ defines the time used to load the capacitor. An exemplary calculation for thi timing is shown in Equation 17-1 in the datasheet. Look at the equation, understand it and use the given $T_{ACQ}$ for your configuration.
The procedure to convert an analog input into a digital value is explained in chapter 17.2.10 of the datasheet. You will find comments in the given main.c showing you where to implement those steps. Follow the instruction from the datasheet and configure your ADC.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to know the Osciallators frequency to determine the clock selection setting for the ADC, make sure to check configuration of the oscillator before configuring ADC-module's clock selection. Additionaly, keep in mind that $2\,\mu s$ is a good value for $T_{AD}$.
